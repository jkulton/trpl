# 2. Programming a Guessing Game

- By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the "prelude" ...
- If a type isn't in the prelude we can bring it into scope with a `use` statement

## Variables

Variables are immutable by default. To make a variable mutable we add `mut` before the variable name.

```rs
let oranges = 2;  // immutable
let mut kiwis = 3 // mutable
```
